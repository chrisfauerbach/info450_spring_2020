# Homework!

Write a program that reads a set of 10 whole numbers from the user into an array.

Once read in, it calculates the mean and the standard deviation of the numbers then displays the results to the console.

1. Find the mean (the simple average of the numbers)
2. Then, for each number, subtract the mean and square the result.
3. Then, work out the mean of those squared differences.
4. Take the square root of that, and we're done!

```c++
github/-your repo-/week4/program1.cpp
```

---

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
const int MAX_NUMBERS = 10;

int main(){
  int x = 0, sum = 0;
  float mean, std_dev, temp_float = 0;

  int all_numbers[MAX_NUMBERS];
  float each_numbers[MAX_NUMBERS];

  for (x = 0;x < MAX_NUMBERS;x++){
    cout << "Enter the number for index " << x << ": ";
    cin >> all_numbers[x];
  }
  for (x = 0;x < MAX_NUMBERS;x++){
    cout << "[" << all_numbers[x] << "] ";
  }
  for (x = 0;x < MAX_NUMBERS;x++){
    sum += all_numbers[x];
  }
  mean = (float) sum / MAX_NUMBERS;
  cout << endl << "Mean is: " << mean << endl;
  for (x = 0;x < MAX_NUMBERS;x++){
    std_dev += pow((float)all_numbers[x] - mean, 2);
  }
  std_dev = std_dev / MAX_NUMBERS;
  std_dev = sqrt(std_dev);
  cout << "The std deviation is: " << std_dev << endl;

  return 0;

}

# Homework 2!


Write a program that inputs the names of the students in the class (to a max of 30 names)

Store them in a 2-dimensional array

Then outputs the class list to the console when the user enters an empty string (by pressing enter)
---

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

const int MAX_STUDENTS = 30;
const int MAX_SIZE = 255;
int main(){
  int x = 0;
  int count  = 0;
  char students[MAX_STUDENTS][MAX_SIZE];
  for(x = 0;x < MAX_STUDENTS;x++){
    strcpy(students[x], "");
  }
  for(x = 0;x < MAX_STUDENTS;x++){
    cout << "Please enter student for index " << x << " :";
    cin.getline(students[x], MAX_SIZE);
    if (!strcmp("0", students[x]) ){
      cout << "Got a 0, breaking." << endl;
      break;
    }
    count++ ;
  }
  for(x = 0;x < count;x++){
    cout << "students[" << x << "] = " << students[x] << endl;
  }
}
```

# Example - String input / output

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char str[100];
  cout << "Please enter a string: " << endl;
  cin >> str;
  cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;
  cout << "Please enter another string: " << endl;
  cin >> str;
  cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;

  return 0;
}
 

```
---
# Uh oh, what happened?

<img src="bad_input.png" width="100%"/>

* Only "My" is displayed instead of "My name is chris"
* This is because the extract operator >> considers space as a termination character.


---
# Strings - cin.getline()

2 forms:
```c++
istream& getline (char* s, streamsize n);
istream& getline (char* s, streamsize n, char delim);
```

* Extracts characters from the stream and stores them into <i>s</i> as a c-string, until either the extract character is the <i>delimiting character</i>, or <i>n</i> characters have been written to <i>s</i> (including the terminating null character.

* The delimiting character is the newline character (\n) for the first form, and <i>delim</i> for the second: when found in the input sequence, it is extracted from the input sequence, but discarded and not written to s.

* A <i>null character</i> '\0' is automatically appended to the written sequence if <i>n</i> is greater than zero, even if an empty string is extracted.

---
# Example 

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char str[100];
  cout << "Please enter a string: " << endl;
  cin.getline(str,100);
  cout << "You entered: " << endl;

  cout << "Please enter another string: " << endl;
  cin.getline(str, 100);
  cout << "You entered: " << str << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
---
# Practice - String input / output

* Write a program to input your name in the keyboard, save it to an array and then iterate through the array to count the number of characters of the inputted text.


---

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  const int MAX = 255;
  char line[MAX];
  int count = 0;
  int x = 0;
  cout << "Please enter a line of text: " << endl;
  cin.getline(line, MAX);

  while (line[x] != 0){
    count++;
    x++;
  }
  cout << "There are " << count << " characters in your string of: " << line << endl;
  return 0;
}

```

# String Common Library Function

C++ supports a wide range of string manipulation functions

cstring

Commonly used ones:
* strcpy() // copy a string from one to another
* strcat() // concatenate one string to another
* strlen() // get the length of a string
* strcmp() // compare a string w/ another

---
# String - strcpy()
<i>strcpy(to, from)</i>

* Copies string 'from' into string 'to'
* The 'to' string must be large enough to hold the copied string
* Both strings must be null-terminated and the resulting string will be null terminated

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  char s1[100] = "";
  char s2[100] = "Joseph";
  
  strcpy(s1, s2);

  cout << "s1: *" << s1 << "* and s2: *" << s2 << "*" << endl;
  return 0;
}


```
---
# String - strcat()
<i>strcat(to, from)</i>

Append string 'from' to string 'to'

The 'to' string must be large enough to hold the concatenated strings

Both strings must be null-terminated and the resulting string will be null-terminated

```c++

#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  char firstName[] = "Mickey";
  char lastName[] = "Mouse";
  char fullName[100] = "";
  strcat(fullName, firstName);
  strcat(fullName, " ");
  strcat(fullName, lastName);

  cout << "Full Name is: " << fullName << endl;
  return 0;
}


```

---
# String - strcmp()
<i>strcmp(s1, s2)</i>
* The function returns 0 if they are equal.   1 if s1 > s2 and -1 if s1 < s2

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char password1[100] = "";
  char password2[100] = "";

  cout << "Enter password: ";
  cin.getline(password1, 100);
  cout << "Re-Enter password: ";
  cin.getline(password2, 100);

  while(strcmp(password1, password2)){
    cout << "Entered passwords are not the same. Try again." << endl;
    cout << "Enter password: ";
    cin.getline(password1, 100);
    cout << "Re-Enter password: ";
    cin.getline(password2, 100);
  }

  cout << "Passwords are the same. Match succeeded." << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

---
# String - strlen()
<i>strlen(s1)</i>

* Returns the length of s1, not including the null terminating character

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char password1[100] = "";
  char password2[100] = "";
    cout << "Passwords MUST be the same AND ";
    cout << "password lengths must be at least 8 characters.";
    cout << endl;
  cout << "Please enter a password: ";
  cin.getline(password1,100);
  cout << "Please re-enter a password: ";
  cin.getline(password2,100);

  while (strcmp(password1, password2) || strlen(password1) < 8){
    cout << "Passwords MUST be the same AND ";
    cout << "password lengths must be at least 8 characters.";
    cout << endl;
    cout << "Please enter a password: ";
    cin.getline(password1,100);
    cout << "Please re-enter a password: ";
    cin.getline(password2,100);
  }
  cout << "Password was successful." << endl;
}

```

# String functions in VS2015
* Apparently, C++ in Visual Studio has deprecated some standard functions for security.
* <i>#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS</i>
* You can use the new string functions OR add preprocessor directives to the stdafx.h header file
* When the pre-processor sees this directive, it ignores the deprecated functions

```c++
// stdafx.h include file for your awesome Visual Studio machines
#pragma once
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#include "targetver.h"
#include "stdio.h"
#include "targetver.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <tchar.h>

```
---
# Practice
* Write a function that accepts a phrase (C string) and counts the number of letter (non-space) and returns that value.  
  * <i>int letters_minus_whitespace(char[] value)</i>

* Write a function that accepts a phrase (C string) and counts the number of words in the phrase and returns that value, words are separated by a space or a tab.
  * <i>int word_count(char[] value)</i>

* Write a function that accepts a phrase (C string) and reverses the content of the string.  
  * <i>void reverse_string(char[] &value)</i>

* Write a function that accepts a word and determines if it is a palindrome. 
  * <i>bool is_palindrome(char[] value)</i>
