# Classroom norms

* Use the restroom at your leisure
* Bring food that doesn't have a strong odor or loud crunch
* Be on time, but late is better than absence
* Take copious notes.  I talk a lot and not everything is in slides
* ASK QUESTIONS - I move fast.  Silence means understanding
* Respect your classmates, respect the room, respect me
* <strong>Cheating sucks</strong> don't do it. 
* Assignments turned in late will be accepted up to one week late for 50% maximum credit.  ALL must be turned in by the final exam.* This is a hard class.  Do not expect an `A`

I am always willing to go above and beyond to help folks who care.  

Your attitude means everything.

# Programming
<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 2em;line-height:1.8em;">
is the process
of creating a set of
instructions that tell a
computer how to perform a
task. Programming can be
done using a variety of
computer languages
</div>

# Why learn to program?
 All the reasons!

 + Programming help develop problem solving skills 
 + Programming teaches you how to think in both structured and create way
 + Programming makes things easier
 + Programming teaches you persistence 
 + Check out developer salary ranges
 + It’s cool...

# Why are we learning C++?

<div style="text-align:center;font-size: 2em;line-height:1.8em;">
<strong>Python</strong> is obviously the best language in the universe.  C++ is a much lower level language, closer to how the machine works.

* Version Control Software: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control
```
Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software 
team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps 
track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. 
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier 
versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to 
all team members.
```

* GitHub -- github.com

* Create an account

#  Git in a nutshell

Github.com is your master repository
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github">Github help</a>
* Create a repository in the github.com site
* Use VSCode or command line 'git' to clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:chrisfauerbach/info450_spring_2020.git
```
* Make changes, add files, etc locally.
* Add new files:
```bash
git add newfile.cpp
```
* Commit new file
```bash
git commit -m "I am committing a new file."
```
* Push remote:
```bash
git push
```

# Comments
<strong>Comments</strong> are statements that
do not affect the compiling or
running of a program

Comments are simply
explanatory remarks that the
programmer includes in a
program to clarify what is taking
place

These remarks are useful to
later program users because
they might help explain the
intent of a particular statement
or the purpose of the entire
program

C++ supports both line and block comments

```c++
//  A line comment

/* 
  a block comment
*/
```

---
# Preprocessors and Namespace

A preprocessor is a tool that runs before
the actual compilation starts.

Preprocessor directives are commands
for the preprocessor and always start
with a pound sign \#

<strong>\#include <iostream></strong> is a preprocessor
directive that tells the preprocessor to
include the iostream standard header file

Header files are files that contain
predefined values and routines

The ` < >` tells the compiler to look in
predefined header directories only
(generally where the STL is kept).

`""` tells to compiler to look in the local
directory, and usually the predefined
header directories as

A namespace preprocessor directive tells
the compiler that the subsequent code is
making use of names in the specified
namespace. In this case, `namespace std`
refers to the C standard library

---
# Main
Every C++ program contains at least
one function, and that function is
called `main()`

The body of every function in a C++
program is a sequence of
statements contained in curly
braces, also known as curly brackets
```c++
{ }
```

All complete C++ statements end
with a semicolon

It is a standardized convention that
function `main()` is declared with
an int preceding it. `int` is the return
value type of the function `main()`.

The programmer can use the return
value of `main()` to convey a success
or error state to the parent
application.

Conventionally a `0` is returned for
success and non-zero failure

---

# cout

The cout in the statement the
writes "Hello World" to the console
screen is a stream defined in the
standard (std) namespace

The insertion operator () is used
to put the text "Hello World" into
the stream.

The endl is used to end the line (like
a carriage return and/or new line)

The compiler was able to compile
Line that contains cout because we
instructed the preprocessor to
include the definition of std::cout in with 

```c++
#include <iostream.h>
``` 

and
identified the appropriate namespace

```c++
namespace std;
```

---
--- 

# Why namespaces?

With namespace declaration:
```c++
namespace std;
int main()
{
  cout << "Hi mom!" << endl;
}
```
Without namespace declaration:
```c++
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hi mom!" << endl;
}
```



---
# Building your program

1. Preprocessor

  * Takes the source code and evaluates the preprocessor directives (e.g. #includes, #defines, etc)

  * Generates a preprocessed source files

2. Compiling

  * Takes the preprocessed source code and compiles to object code
  * Check for syntax and semantic rules (e.g. type checking)

3. Linking
  * Takes the object files and links them into an executable program

---

# Running!

I'm a mac guy, not a Windows person.  <br/>

This is what I do to run my sample program:<br/>

```shell
ls -latr
touch program.cpp
g++ program.cpp
chmod +x a.out
./a.out

```
<img style="width: 100%;" src="sample.png"/>

# Your turn!

Open your books.  Chapter 2.   Find the first two programs.
```c++
/* Program 1
Chris Fauerbach
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// main() is where program execution begins
// on a mac, this is compiled with `c++ program1.cpp`
// then run with ./a.out

int main()
{
  cout << "This is my first C++ program.\n";
  return 0;

}

```
---
# Program 2 

```c++
// Program # 2 - Using a variable

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x; //  this declares variable x
           // with type int

    x = 1023;

    cout << "This program prints the values of x: ";
    cout << x; // This displays 1023
    cout << "\n"; //CHF Adding new line.
    return 0;
}

```

# Working with Variables

* A variable is used to store information and is referenced or used by a program.

* All variables in C++ are composed of three parts:
   * Type
   * Name
   * Value
      * <i>Values can be undefined</i> 
---
# Working with variables: <i>Names</i>

In C++, names can include letters, number and underscores, yet they can not begin with a number or an underscore.
* Good
   * average
   * daily_average
* Bad
   * _average
   * 1daily
* Names are case sensitive
   * average != AVERAGE
* No spaces or other special characters are allowed within a C++ variable name
   * Total Amount
   * Total!
* Every programming language contains a few vocabulary words, or special 'keywords', that you need in order to use the language; these keywords can NOT be used in variable names.

---
# Common C++ Keywords

---
# Working with variables - Types

* C++ supports four simple types: boolean, character, integer & float

* An Integer is a whole number, either positive or negative

* An Integer value may be stored in an integer variable declared with the keyword <span style="color: blue">int</span>, <span style="color: blue">short int</span> or <span style="color: blue">long int</span>

* A Floating-point number is a number that include decimal positions, such as 98.6, 1000.00002, and -3.85 

* They may be stored in variables with type <span style="color: blue">float</span>, <span style="color: blue">double</span>, and <span style="color: blue">long double</span>

* A <span style="color: blue">char</span> may hold any single symbol in the ASCII character set

* Often it contains a letter of the alphabet, but it could include a space, digit, punctuation mark, arithmetic symbol, or other special symbol

* A <span style="color: blue">boolean</span> variable is one that only supports values of true and false


---
# Working with Variables - Sizes

<img src="sizes.png" width="100%"/>

The size of the given data type is dependent on the compiler and/or the computer architecture.

C++ does guarantee that the basic types will have a minimum size.

---
# Variable Declarations

* A declaration associates a type and a name with a variable and allows the complier to interpret the statements correctly 
* To declare a variable, you list its name and its type

* A variable declaration is a C++ statement, so it must end with a semicolon

* If you write a function that contains variables of diverse types, each variable must be declared in a statement of its own

* If you want to declare two or more variables of the same type, you may declare them in the same statement

* A variable can also be initialized as part of the declaration statement

* When a variable declaration is executed, memory is allocated for the variable. This memory must be initialized to contain some definite value before the variable should be used in an expression.

---
# Variable Declarations

## Examples
Declare
* int i;
* int x, y, z;  <strong><span style="color: red">#CHF - but don't</span></strong>
* double area;
* char my_letter;
* <span style="color: red">int i, double area;</span> # CHF - this is invalid

Declare and Initialize
* int i = 200;
* int x = 10, y = 20, z = 30; # CHF - but don't do this 
* double area = 20.1;
* char my_letter = 'A';
* <span style="color: red">char invalid_assignment = "B";</span>    # CHF - Must be single ticks '


---
# The <span style="color: blue">const</span> qualifier

* A variable that does not change value does not need to be declared as a variable.
* Instead, it should be a constant:
```c++
const double MINIMUM_VALUE = 25.0;
```
declares a constant named MINIMUM_VALUE that can be used as a variable but cannot be changed during the program execution.
---
# C++ binary arithmetic operators

C++ provides five simple arithmetic operators for creating arithmetic expressions: 
* <span style="color: blue">\+</span> addition
* <span style="color: blue">\-</span> subtraction
* <span style="color: blue">\*</span> multiplication
* <span style="color: blue">%</span> modulus

Examples:
```c++
int a = 10;
int b = 12;
int c;
int d;
int e;
c = a + b;
d = c / 2;
e = d % 5;
cout << c << endl; # What's c?
cout << d << endl; # What's d?
cout << e << endl; # What's e?

```
	
---
# Putting it all together - Circle program
```c++
// Sample program that calculates the 
// circumference and area of a circle

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  const double PI = 3.14;
  int radius = 5;
  double area;
  double circumference;

  circumference = 2 * PI * radius;
  area = PI * (radius * radius);  // pow(radius, 2) ?
  cout << "The circumference is: << circumference << endl;
  cout << "The area is: << area << endl;

  return 0;
}
```
---
# HOMEWORK
